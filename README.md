# Project 

This is my first template using the dcl project-workflow specification, [link](https://dcl-2020-01.github.io/curriculum/project-workflow.html). The goal is to learn tidy workflow that integrates github and Rstudio seamlessly, while also using Makefiles for smooth updating. This also serves as my Data Challenge Lab c12 homework assignment.
